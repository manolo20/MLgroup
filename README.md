Mathematics / Machine Learning group

The objective of this repository is to have a place where we can save all our presentations.

During our weekly sessions, we will be covering the following topics:

1. Generative Models

    Generative Adversarial Networks.
    Variational Autoencoders (VAE)
    Flow based methods (normalized flows)

 
2. Information Theory, Information Geometry and Natural Gradients

    Basic tools (definitions, etc)
    Go through a textbook or some basic review papers.

3. Reinforcement Learning

    Bandits
    Theory/background of Markov Decision Process (MDP)
    Optimality
    Value iteration, policy iteration
    Value based methods
    Policy search (policy gradient) methods

 4. Statistical Learning Theory

    Framework; Rademacher Complexity; VC dimension; basic bounds
