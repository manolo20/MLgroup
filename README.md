# MLgroup

Mathematics / Machine Learning group

The objective of this repository is to have a place where we can save all our presentations.

During our weekly sessions, we will be covering the following topics:

Generative Models

    GANs
    VAE
    Flow based methods (normalized flows)

 
Information Theory, Information Geometry and Natural Gradients

    Basic tools (definitions, etc)
    Go through a textbook or some basic review papers? (not sure what to put here since I know almost nothing)

RL

    Bandits
    Theory/background of MDPs
    Optimality...in what sense?!
    Value iteration, policy iteration
    Value based methods
    Policy search (policy gradient) methods

Statistical Learning Theory

    Framework; Rademacher Complexity; VC dimension; basic bounds
    SVMs

Semi Supervised Learning (SSL)

    Overall assumptions; positive and negative theoretical results
    Graph based methods (Laplacian framework)
    Label propagation methods
    Modern (NN) methods

Active Learning

    Learning theory
    Fisher information methods
    ensemble methods

Metric Learning

    Formal theory (Mahalanobis methods)
    Triplet loss function
    Siamese networks and other modern approaches (embeddings, etc)

Neural Networks

    Basics (activation functions, computation graphs, backpropagation, loss functions and objective functions)
    Basics II (standard practices in training/testing; detecting overfitting/underfitting; regularization methods)
    CNNs 
    RNN/LSTMs
    Attention
    Auxiliary tasks (e.g. multi-headed NN's)

Kernel Methods

    Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
    Kernel density estimation
    approximating kernel methods

Manifold Learning
Bayesian methods; Gaussian processes; MCMC
