# Week 1

Saeid presented "Generative and Discriminative models". Some of the references that he used were the following:
 
    https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io
    https://ermongroup.github.io/generative-models/
    https://www.shakirm.com/slides/DeepGenModelsTutorial.pdf

 
There are also more links to other tutorials in the first two links. Feel free to explore and share if you find some interesting talk, blog, etc. Once we have a github page, I will put the links in there too. Also, any comment on the format, scope, depth, day/time etc of the series would be very much appreciated.
