Nick is currently presenting an introduction to reinforcement learning.

To complement Nickâ€™s last week talk, here is a blog post explaining the k-armed bandits: https://oneraynyday.github.io/ml/2018/05/03/Reinforcement-Learning-Bandit/

Same blog, but a post on Markov Decision Processes (which will be covered by Nick today): https://oneraynyday.github.io/ml/2018/05/06/Reinforcement-Learning-MDPs/
